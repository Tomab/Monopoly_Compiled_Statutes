# Monopoly_Compiled_statutes

This github project is essentially a set of rules for use in the popular board game Monopoly.  In our experience the stock rules did not cover many cases and disputes.  This set of rules seeks to clarify grey areas and present the players with acceptable means to resolve disputes.

The rules are organized into sections.  In this repository each section is a text file.  Within each text file the rules are further organized into sub-sections and paragraphs so that players can quickly and easily reference specific rules.  The choice to use a github repository was made so that distinct versions can exist and so that players can choose to use a specific version of the rules should they choose.  It is, after all, important that the players agree on the rules to play by (MCS 30-5(a)).

In addition to the rules there is a small C# project called MCS-Compiler.  If the C# project is built, the binary will be placed in the compiler-bin folder.  Run MCS-Compiler.exe and all of the text files in the repository's root folder will be concatenated into an html file.  The html file will be placed in the output folder.  The section titles will be bolded as well is the sub-section numbers.  I've found that if your vision is good, you can copy-paste this into a Word document at font size 6.5 with three columns across and print this double-sided onto a single piece of paper.  Three sets of the rules seem to suffice for most games.

For those not interested in compiling their own statutes, check out the 'releases' section here on github for some pre-compiled .html .docx and .pdf versions for distribution.

The MCS will be organized into sections, subsections, and paragraphs in the following format:
